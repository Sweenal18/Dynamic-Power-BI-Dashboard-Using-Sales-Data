### Technical Details:

- Data Processing: Data was cleaned, transformed, and loaded into Power BI using Power Query. DAX expressions were used to create calculated measures and columns for in-depth analysis.

- Interactivity: The dashboard includes interactive features such as slicers and filters, allowing users to drill down into specific data points and customize their view.

### Following DAX expression was written to calculate total Revenue, Revenue PY, Revenue Variance, Revenue Color, Revenue Growth & Revenue Growth Arrow
 
- #### Total Revenue
 
         Revenue = SUM(factSalesData[Sales Amount (USD)])

- #### Revenue Previous Year

         Revenue PY = CALCULATE([Revenue], PREVIOUSYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))
     
- #### Revenue Variance

         Revenue Variance = [Revenue] - [Revenue PY]

- #### Revenue Color

         Revenue Color = 
            if(
               [Revenue Variance]>=0,
               "Green",
               "Red"
              )

- #### Revenue Growth

         Revenue Growth = DIVIDE([Revenue Variance], [Revenue PY], 0)    

- #### Revenue Growth Arrow

        Revenue Growth Arrow = 
        if (
                ISBLANK([Revenue]),
                BLANK(),
        IF(
           [Revenue Variance] > 0,
           "+" & ROUND([Revenue Growth] * 100, 1) & "%" & "↑",
           ROUND([Revenue Growth] * 100, 1) & "%" & "↓"
        ))
